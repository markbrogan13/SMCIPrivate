Testing plans and log gathering for Morteza to cover for Mark while on flight
Thank you for assisting me Morteza!

Was able to get Morteza's public key to ssh into the jump server onsite
to login:
    ssh -i C:\Users\mortezas/.ssh/id_rsa test@79.135.120.161

From ssh on the jump server, you are able to attach to any raritan PDU
    PDU IPs: 192.64.198.1-192.64.198.144 (mapped out in the PDU_IPs Excel spreadsheet)
    PDU Login: admin/raritan

    to ssh:
        ssh admin@<PDU_IP>
        password: raritan

    Use this link to learn about the Raritan PDUs 

    PDU Logs looking to gather:
        `show eventlog class sensor`
        `show eventlog class pdu`

For PDU GUI from your Browser:
Utilize a SOCKS proxy:
    From a Command Prompt Window:
        ssh -i C:\Users\mortezas/.ssh/id_rsa -D 8080 -N test@79.135.120.161

        This will tunnel your connection to the Jump Server through port 8080 to localhost
        Head into your Browser, and locate your SOCKS Proxy settings:
            Manual Proxy Settings > SOCKS Host > localhost | Port: 8080
        
    You can then head to any PDU_IP via that browser and login with admin/raritan

    From here you can pull and download the PDU graphs in .csv format, which will be needed
    Harmonic Distortion
    Voltage
    Wattage
    Phase Angle
    Current Amperage
    etc..
